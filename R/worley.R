#' Worley (cell) noise generator
#'
#' Worley noise, sometimes called cell (or cellular) noise, is quite distinct
#' due to it's kinship to voronoi tesselation. It is created by sampling random
#' points in space and then for any point in space measure the distance to the
#' closest point. The noise can be modified further by changing either the
#' distance measure or by combining multiple distances. The noise algorithm was
#' developed by Steven Worley in 1996 and has been used to simulated water and
#' stone textures among other things.

#' @inheritParams noise_perlin
#' @param distance The distance measure to use, either `'euclidean'` (default),
#' `'manhattan'`, or `'natural'` (a mix of the two)
#' @param value The noise value to return. Either
#' - `'value'` (default) A random value associated with the closest point
#' - `'distance'` The distance to the closest point
#' - `'distance2'` The distance to the nth closest point (n given by
#' `distance_ind[1]`)
#' - `'distance2add'` Addition of the distance to the nth and mth closest point given in `distance_ind`
#' - `'distance2sub'` Substraction of the distance to the nth and mth closest point given in `distance_ind`
#' - `'distance2mul'` Multiplication of the distance to the nth and mth closest point given in `distance_ind`
#' - `'distance2div'` Division of the distance to the nth and mth closest point given in `distance_ind`
#' @param distance_ind Reference to the nth and mth closest points that should
#' be used when calculating `value`.
#' @param jitter The maximum distance a point can move from its start position
#' during sampling of cell points.
#'
#' @return If `length(dim) == 2` a matrix, if `length(dim) == 3` a 3-dimensional
#' array.
